# disk-status

Still in dev.

Project goals:

* Output disk status (terminal and log)
* Notify when there are issues (likely configurable)

Todo:

* Exit with non-zero exit code when there are errors
* Add pre/post run commands for whole script and for individual disks
* Consider configurable notification threshold
